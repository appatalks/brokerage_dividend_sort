# Transform Dividends Script

This script transforms a CSV file containing dividend and interest data into a new format where dates are columns, stock symbols are rows, and payouts are placed in corresponding cells. 


To use, place `transform_dividends.py` and `dividends.csv` in the same directory and run the script using Python 3; it will generate `transformed_dividends.csv` with the organized data.
